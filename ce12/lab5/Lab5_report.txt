MIPS was not too hard to me to learn and get used to because it’s a mix of what I’ve learn from
LC-3  and the C language. The few things that confused me at first were the different TRIS and PORT for buttons and switches on UNO32 kit, but after attending multiple lab sections and asking lab
tutors I finally understood and was able to go through the whole lab 5 smoothly.
Part 1 of the lab was easy to complete once I understood the buttons, switches, and LED’s positions
in binary, and how to shift them. The confusing portion of Part 2 was the jump to subroutine and return back to original spot, but once I got over that, the rest of the idea was not too hard.
Attending multiple lab sections was really helpful, as I was able to hear different lab tutors’
explanation, and get my questions answered instead of being frustrated by myself.
